    <h1>Spring Helloworld WebApp Example</h1>
    <p>This example demonstrates how to create simple Jersey application that utilises Spring 3 DI features,
      packaged into WAR file.
    </p>
    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
	<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<th>URI path</th>
	<th>Resource class</th>
	<th>HTTP methods</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/jersey-hello</td>
	<td>JerseyResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/spring-hello</td>
	<td>SpringRequestResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/spring-singleton-hello</td>
	<td>SpringSingletonResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>

	</table>

    <p>Application is configured by using web.xml, which registers
        <a href="https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/nonav/2.0/apidocs/javax/ws/rs/core/Application.html">javax.ws.rs.core.Application</a> descendant to get
       classes and singletons from it (see class MyApplication).</p>

    <h2>Running the Example</h2>
         <p>Run the example as follows:</p>
        <blockquote><pre>
mvn clean compile jetty:run</pre></blockquote>
        <p>This deploys current example using Jetty web server.
            Once deployed, the application is ready to serve the following resources:
            <ul>
             <li><a href="http://localhost:8080/helloworld-spring-webapp/jersey-hello">http://localhost:8080/helloworld-spring-webapp/jersey-hello</a></li>
             <li><a href="http://localhost:8080/helloworld-spring-webapp/spring-hello">http://localhost:8080/helloworld-spring-webapp/spring-hello</a></li>
             <li><a href="http://localhost:8080/helloworld-spring-webapp/spring-singleton-hello">http://localhost:8080/helloworld-spring-webapp/spring-singleton-hello</a></li>
           </ul>
        </p>
  </body>
