<h1>Flight Management Web Application Example</h1>

<p>
    This example demonstrates various Jersey features, namely:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jersey Test Framework</li>
    <li>Monitoring and Tracing support</li>
    <li>Bean Validation integration</li>
    <li>Implementing custom security context provider & use of standard security annotations</li>
    <li>Entity Filtering support</li>
    <li>MVC Templates</li>
    <li>SSE events; including a simple HTML5 animation based on data received from SSE events</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Flight Management Web Application is a simple demo application for managing (creating, updating, deleting, reserving)
    flights and aircrafts and their subsequent animated flight simulation on HTML5 canvas using streamed SSE data.
</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>
    The example consists of 3 main resource classes:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt><code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.flight.resources.AircraftsResource</code></dt>
    <dd>
        Resource exposing aircraft data (collections or individual aircraft instances) as well as methods for manipulating
        the aircraft data.
    </dd>
    <dt><code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.flight.resources.FlightsResource</code></dt>
    <dd>
        Resource exposing flight data (collections or individual flight instances) as well as methods for manipulating
        the flight data.
    </dd>
    <dt><code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.flight.resources.FlightSimResource</code></dt>
    <dd>
        Resource controlling the flight simulation lifecycle and exposing SSE stream of simulation events
        (changes in flight locations).
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>All the application JAX-RS resources are deployed under the same <code>api</code> root path.
    The mapping of the URI path space for the individual resources is presented in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>HTTP method</th>
        <th>Description</th>

        <td><code>GET</code></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td><code>POST</code></td>
        <td>
            Change flight status. (input: <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>; output: new status name - TXT);
            Requires "admin" role.

            Requires "admin" role.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><code>/aircrafts/available</code></td>
        <td><code>GET</code></td>
        <td>Retrieve list of available aircrafts (not assigned to a flight) - XML, JSON</td>

<h2>Building and Running the Example</h2>

<p>
    Flight Management Web Application Example is a web application (WAR) that can be deployed to any Servlet 3.x container.
    By default, the examples runs on Jetty using the Jetty Maven plugin. Before the example is run, it must be built first:
</p>
<pre>
  mvn clean package
</pre>
<p>
    This command builds the example WAR and runs all the unit tests against the example application.
</p>
<p>
    Once the example is built, it can be run as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  mvn jetty:run
</pre>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>
    When the example is run using the Jetty Maven plugin as described above, the example Web application gets deployed to the
    local host under port <code>8080</code>. As mentioned earlier, the resources can be accessed directly under common
    <code>api</code> root path. Here are a few links to directly access some of the <code>HTTP GET</code> operations on the
    application resources:
</p>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost:8080/api/flights">http://localhost:8080/api/flights</a></code>
<br/>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost:8080/api/flights/open">http://localhost:8080/api/flights/open</a></code>
<br/>

<br/>

<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost:8080/api/aircrafts">http://localhost:8080/api/aircrafts</a></code>
<br/>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost:8080/api/aircrafts/available">http://localhost:8080/api/aircrafts/available</a></code>
<br/>
<p>
    The HTML application root to be accessed via browser is represented by the application <code>index.html</code> page:
</p>

<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost:8080/index.html">http://localhost:8080/index.html</a></code>
